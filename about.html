      <h2 class="chapter__title">Twelve-hour days. A body in revolt.</h2>
      <div class="chapter__body">
        <p>
          I spent the better part of a decade building software. Long hours in front of screens,
          the kind of pressure that feels like productivity until the day your body simply refuses
          to cooperate. For me, that refusal started quietly — tightness across the shoulders that
          never fully released, a fatigue that sleep couldn't fix, headaches that arrived without
          invitation and stayed for days.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was in my early thirties. I had a computer science master's degree and a career I'd
          worked hard for. I also had a neck that felt like concrete and a digestive system that
          had forgotten how to function without protest. I saw doctors. I tried physical therapy.
          I bought every ergonomic gadget the internet recommended. The problems would ease,
          briefly, and then return — usually worse after a deadline sprint.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a specific kind of exhaustion that comes not from working too hard, but from
          working in a way that is fundamentally disconnected from how your body was designed
          to operate. I didn't have a word for it then. I just knew that something had to change,
          and the changes I was making weren't reaching deep enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't quit. I didn't burn out spectacularly. I just reached a quiet turning point
          where I understood, with complete clarity, that optimizing my career was meaningless
          if I couldn't also sustain the body doing the work.

      <span class="chapter__number">Chapter Two</span>
      <h2 class="chapter__title">Ancient answers to modern problems.</h2>
      <div class="chapter__body">
        <p>
          My introduction to Traditional Chinese Medicine was not mystical. It was practical.
          A colleague mentioned she'd been seeing a TCM practitioner for a chronic lower back
          condition that Western medicine hadn't resolved. I was skeptical — I'm a systems
          thinker, trained to look for evidence. But I was also desperate enough to try
          something different.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I found surprised me. Not the treatments themselves, though those helped. What
          surprised me was the framework — the idea that the body is a network of interconnected
          systems, that energy moves along specific pathways, and that disruption in one area
          inevitably surfaces in another. As someone who'd spent years thinking about how complex
          software systems fail, this mapping felt intuitive in a way I hadn't expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started studying. First informally — books, practitioners, seminars. Then formally.
          I enrolled in a structured TCM program while still working, studied meridian theory,
          acupoint anatomy, gua sha, and tui na. It took years. There were late nights that
          looked very different from my old late nights — fewer screens, more textbooks filled
          with anatomical diagrams I was slowly learning to read in both Chinese and English.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I finally received my Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioner certification,
          I had something I didn't have before: a language for what had been happening in my
          body, and practical tools to address it. More than that, I had results I could feel.
          The shoulder tension that had been my constant companion for years — measurably,
          consistently better. Not because I'd found a workaround, but because I'd learned to
          address the actual source.

    <!-- Chapter 3 -->
    <section class="chapter reveal">
      <span class="chapter__number">Chapter Three</span>
      <h2 class="chapter__title">What actually worked.</h2>
      <div class="chapter__body">
        <p>
          The tools matter. This is something I had to learn by working with many different
          implements before I understood what made certain ones genuinely effective and others
          merely decorative.
        </p>
        <p>
          Copper kept appearing in my research and practice. H65 copper specifically — an alloy
          with enough hardness to hold a useful edge while retaining the thermal conductivity
          and natural microbicidal properties that make copper genuinely functional in bodywork.
          When copper contacts skin at the right pressure and angle, you feel it working in a
          way that plastic or stainless steel simply don't replicate. There's a warmth to it.
          A responsiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wood components — black walnut, rosewood, golden silk ebony — aren't aesthetic
          choices. Each wood has a different density, a different feel in the hand after extended
          use. Hand-sanding without lacquer or chemical coating matters because you're pressing
          these tools against skin. What goes on the tool eventually contacts you. I refused to
          compromise on that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every piece I selected or helped refine went through months of testing in my own
          practice before I considered sharing it. The curves had to follow actual anatomy —
          not a designer's approximation of anatomy, but the real contours of the orbital bone,
          the nasolabial groove, the sternocleidomastoid. The weight had to make sense for
          sustained use. I've discarded a lot of beautiful objects because they didn't work
          as tools.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Chapter 4 -->
    <section class="chapter reveal">
      <span class="chapter__number">Chapter Four</span>
      <h2 class="chapter__title">Not a brand. A practice.</h2>
      <div class="chapter__body">
        <p>
          I didn't set out to start a company. I set out to share something that worked — and
          found that the most honest way to do that was to put the tools directly in people's
          hands, with enough context to actually use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          MERIDIAN exists because I kept having the same conversation: colleagues asking what
          I was using on my face, friends noticing that something had shifted. Everyone wanted
          the tools, but more importantly, they wanted to understand why the tools worked —
          the meridian logic behind each motion, the anatomical reasoning beneath each curve.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's what MERIDIAN tries to be. Not a wellness brand selling aesthetics. A
          practitioner's approach, made accessible. Every product in this collection has
          a specific anatomical target and a specific TCM rationale. I can explain exactly
          why each piece is shaped the way it is, and which pathways it's designed to address.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ritual isn't decoration. It's the point.
